 **Dataset Used:**

Counting of things in NLP is based on a corpus. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) provides a diverse set of corpora. For our project we'll be using the Brown corpus. The Brown corpus is a 1-million-word collection of samples from 500 written texts from different genres (newspaper, novels, non-fiction etc.). There are tasks such as spelling error detection, word prediction for which the location of the punctuation is important. Our application counts punctuation as words.
